Deploy Emby, Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett and Qbittorrent with PIA using a single compose script.  
Some post install config will be required to allow radarr/sonarr to communicate with Jackett and Qbittorrent.  
If you don't want to use PIA as VPN you can switch the vanilla linuxserver/qbittorrent image.
